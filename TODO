- decide on a licence and apply it (v0 has MIT in LICENCE and Apache in metadata :/)
- use Sensitive data type where it makes sense
- verify TLS certificate
- collect conjur configuration (and encrypted token if applicable) into `conjur_configuration` fact
- use that configuration for defaults
- support host factory tokens
