- decide on a licence and apply it (v0 has MIT in LICENCE and Apache in metadata :/)
- use Sensitive data type where it makes sense
- verify TLS certificate
- collect conjur configuration into `conjur_configuration` fact
- use that configuration for defaults
- fetch a Conjur token and put it encrypted in `conjur_configuration` if applicable
- if the above is present, use that as the token on the master side
- support host factory tokens
- Get module building in Jenkins
